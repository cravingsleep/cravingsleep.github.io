                <h3>Sainsbury's</h3>
                <p>
                    The beginning of this mince pie, much like a bottle of Tango, has a tanginess.
                    The tanginess eminates from the warm centre of the pie, a thick gloop of mincemeat.

                    Perhaps, a bit too thick for some, it must be said.
                    However, the thickness does lend itself well to the microwave rays of the microwave,
                    expect a very hot pie from just a small burst. This makes for an energy efficient pie.
                    There is no doubt that Sainsbury's has kept the carbon footprint of the pie at the forefront
                    of its mind during the design period and in these troubled times is a welcome move.

                    Like the Earth, a mince pie has a crust. Unlike the Earth's crust, this pies crust is a big
                    let down. The pastry is far too big for the mincemeat held inside. A simple bite of the pie
                    forces the mouth to deal with a level of unnacceptable dryness, ironically dampening the experience.
                    Further exasperating the situation is the flakiness of the pastry. Rather unusual for a mince pie
                    and
                    a big problem. These flakes break from the pastry and stick to the roof, walls and upholstery of
                    your mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion the Sainsbury's mince pie is somewhat of a dissapointment. The taste of the pie at
                    times
                    will salvage a star for this review and perhaps it is fair to award it another for the unique and
                    rather
                    cute depiction of a tree on the top of the pie. In every regard however they must try harder.

                <h3>Aldi</h3>
                <p>
                    The Aldi mince pies are always hard ones to review. Which is ironic because the crust of this
                    pie is quite soft. There is no sign of a satisfying crunch when delving into this pie. Some people
                    may claim to like this but they are wrong. The softness of the crust subtracts from the overall
                    experience and eliminates a large part of the usual enjoyment when eating a mince pie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like climate change, we must keep talking about the crust. To banish it to the bin of bad crusts
                    so eagerly would be a grave mistake. This is due to taste of this soft, soft crust. The pie is
                    somewhat redeemed by a very buttery smooth taste that pleasantly delights. It sets up a good beginning
                    for the series of tastes you will experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for those without tongues we must stay on the subject of taste. After all, mince pies are
                    (like most foods) eaten in the mouth. The mincemeat part of this pie is a huge let down. It's clear 
                    these pies have not been raised on natural pastures with lots of wide open space. The taste is heavily
                    artificial. The whole package is let down again (putting it firmly on the floor) by the odd part of fruit
                    being enormously sweet. It comes as quite the shock to the taste buds and is most unwelcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heat of this pie is actually fairly reasonable. A nice amount of heat is encompassed in the pastry and
                    there are no super hot bits lurking in the mincemeat waiting to strike. In conclusion, this pie is a huge
                    dissapointment, its crust is mediocre at best but expect no suprises, the mincemeat can be rancid and nothing
                    works together particulary well. I'd stay away from this one.
