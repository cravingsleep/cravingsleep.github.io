                <h3>Sainsbury's</h3>
                <p>
                    The beginning of this mince pie, much like a bottle of Tango, has a tanginess.
                    The tanginess eminates from the warm centre of the pie, a thick gloop of mincemeat.

                    Perhaps, a bit too thick for some, it must be said.
                    However, the thickness does lend itself well to the microwave rays of the microwave,
                    expect a very hot pie from just a small burst. This makes for an energy efficient pie.
                    There is no doubt that Sainsbury's has kept the carbon footprint of the pie at the forefront
                    of its mind during the design period and in these troubled times is a welcome move.

                    Like the Earth, a mince pie has a crust. Unlike the Earth's crust, this pies crust is a big
                    let down. The pastry is far too big for the mincemeat held inside. A simple bite of the pie
                    forces the mouth to deal with a level of unnacceptable dryness, ironically dampening the experience.
                    Further exasperating the situation is the flakiness of the pastry. Rather unusual for a mince pie and
                    a big problem. These flakes break from the pastry and stick to the roof, walls and upholstery of your mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion the Sainsbury's mince pie is somewhat of a dissapointment. The taste of the pie at times
                    will salvage a star for this review and perhaps it is fair to award it another for the unique and rather
                    cute depiction of a tree on the top of the pie. In every regard however they must try harder.
