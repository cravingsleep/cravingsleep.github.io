      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        My name is Nick and I'm a software developer for Hotels.com. I'm currently
        learning to juggle blind and I am using this website to document my
        progress.

      <h4>Why?</h4>
      <p>
        I've always been interested in how the brain learns and wanted to document a
        learning process involving something I have enough knowledge in to understand
        what is going on but also a task challenging enough to take some time in
        mastering it.
